# Resource Allotment to Schools

A study was conducted regarding schools in the Punjab Province to analyze the impact of availability of resources such as infrastructure, water, electricity and security on the rate of enrollment, number of functional classrooms and availability of teachers. The resource allocation was investigated across each district, location: urban or rural and gender.

## Methodology

- A dataset with over 48k schools was cleaned in Excel and Pivot Tables were used identify problems and provide actionable insights.

- Before diving directly into the impact, it was necessary to highlight if the resource allocation was biased over districts, location or gender.
  For which the no. of schools was compared to availabilty of resources.

- After it was established that the resource allocation was comparable to the number of schools in each district, the impact of availability or lack thereof of 
  resources on operability of each school.

## Key Insights

- There are a lot more schools in rural areas (88% of the total) than urban. And number of schools drops significantly from primary to middle (66% to 17%) and 
  secondary to higher (13% to 2%) secondary schools.

- Resources allocated to are comparable to the number of schools in each ditrict, location, gender-based schools and for all school levels. Security and lack of a  
  boundary wall seem to be the major concerns, followed by electricity for all of the above.
  
- Data shows that the provision of better infrastructure and basic necessities does not just impact the functionality of school but are in fact the defining 
  factors. The operability drops to approximately 0% when some of these conditions (water and electricity) are not met.

## Actionable Insights

- The smaller number of government schools in urban areas must be investigated. It could be due to the preference of people to send their children to private 
  schools for better education and infrastructure.

- Number of schools for higher education must be increased.

- Provision of good infrastuture as well as security to schools must be ensured.

- Additional data is required to understand why some districts have more schools than others. Multiple factors such as area, population, district-level security 
  and how far these schools are located, might be beneficial in understanding why some districts have higher enrollment rate than others.

- Upon further analysis of districts where schools are underperforming, the data shows no disparity to suggest that it is caused by a lack of resources. This 
  necessitates that the local authorities be made resposible to gather additional data to bring forth the factors that might be specific to a particular region.
